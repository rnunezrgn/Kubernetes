🧠 K8-Cluster-Containerd

At the center of it all is Kubernetes, but in RHEL9 it needs a container runtime to actually run containers.
Let’s break down the roles of each component you've mentioned:

🔹 Kubernetes
    • What it is: A container orchestration system — it doesn’t run containers itself.
    • What it needs: A container runtime to actually run containers on each node.

🔹 Container Runtime Interface (CRI)
    • Kubernetes uses something called the CRI to talk to different container runtimes.
    • This allows Kubernetes to support multiple runtimes, like:
        ◦ containerd
        ◦ CRI-O
        ◦ (Historically: Docker, but no longer supported directly as of K8s v1.24+)

🔹 containerd
    • What it is: A high-performance container runtime (written by Docker, but now independent).
    • Kubernetes support: ✅ Officially supported via CRI (as of default in many distros like RHEL, Ubuntu, etc.)
    • What it doesn’t do: It doesn’t include a CLI. You can’t run containerd run ... easily.
    • Used for: Running containers inside Kubernetes.

🔹 Podman
    • What it is: A container engine/CLI tool (Docker replacement on RHEL-based systems).
    • Used for: Managing containers manually (outside Kubernetes) — especially by sysadmins or in CI/CD pipelines.
    • Kubernetes support: ❌ Not directly usable as Kubernetes’ runtime.
    • ✅ Can build images, push/pull from registries.
    • ✅ Often paired with CRI-O if you want a Podman-native stack.

🔹 CRI-O
    • What it is: A lightweight container runtime created specifically for Kubernetes, designed to work with Podman images.
    • Kubernetes support: ✅ Yes, full CRI compliance.
    • Used when: You want an all-Red Hat-native stack: Podman + CRI-O + Kubernetes

🔹 Flannel
    • What it is: A CNI plugin (Container Network Interface)
    • Purpose: Provides pod networking — lets pods talk across nodes
    • Used by: Kubernetes — every cluster needs some kind of CNI (Flannel, Calico, Cilium, etc.)

🧭 Final Notes Before Choosing a Direction
    • Use containerd if you want easier, widely-supported, production-safe setup.
    • Use CRI-O + Podman if you’re in an enterprise Red Hat environment and want consistency and SELinux integrations.
